# Hey there, I’m David 👋

🌍 **Explorer of Code** | 💡 **Student of Software** | 🛠️ **Builder in Progress**  
Welcome to my corner of GitHub — a digital journal of learning, building, breaking, fixing, and growing.

## 🚧 Under Construction — Just Like Me

I'm not a guru (yet), not a wizard (though I’ve got the curiosity of one), but I *am* someone on a determined, sometimes clumsy, always hopeful journey to becoming a **software engineer**.

I started this journey not from a computer science degree, but from a place of raw curiosity, big dreams, and a willingness to figure things out — one bug at a time.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

Right now, I’m deep in the trenches, building projects that challenge me and give me life. My goals are ambitious, but so is my caffeine intake.

### 📚 In My Backpack:
- **Frontend & Backend Development** – With frameworks like **Next.js**, **React**, and tools like **Node.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Prisma**
- **Cloud & DevOps Fundamentals** – Tinkering with **Terraform**, **Docker**, and **Google Cloud**
- **AI + Voice** – Building an audiobook app powered by **OpenAI’s Voice models**
- **Git, GitHub & Version Control** – Because even learners need to commit to something 😉

## 🧩 Current Project: `Verbally`  
An ambitious audiobook application that lets users upload PDFs and magically converts them into *realistic, human-sounding audiobooks*. Think: **Spotify for books**, powered by AI.  
It’s challenging. It’s exciting. It breaks a lot (and I fix it a lot). But hey, that’s how I grow. 💪

## 💬 Why This GitHub Exists

This place isn’t just for showcasing perfection.  
It’s for **learning in public**.  
It’s a logbook of:
- Things I’ve tried,
- Mistakes I’ve made,
- Concepts I’m still wrapping my head around,
- Projects that felt impossible until they weren’t.

If you're on a similar journey — welcome. Let’s get our hands dirty together. 🧠🛠️

## 😅 Fun Fact  
I code better with lo-fi music, warm socks, and the occasional motivational TED Talk whispering, *“You got this.”*

## 🧠 My Philosophy

> “Start where you are. Use what you have. Learn as you go. Break stuff. Fix it. Repeat.”

This is more than a tech career for me — it’s a **calling**. One day, I want to build tools and companies that matter — in education, in access, in opportunity. But today, I’m learning how to build a button that works.

## 📡 Let’s Connect

I'm not perfect, but I'm present. And I’d love to connect, collaborate, or just chat about this beautiful messy road called tech. 🚀
